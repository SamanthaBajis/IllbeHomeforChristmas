# IllbeHomeforChristmas
This repository contains a Unity 3D mobile application for iOS and Andriod devices called "I'll be Home for Christmas". It has been built and tested using the Google Cardboard Platform.
<br />
It is a maze scene where the user must complete the maze in order to win the experience and to restart the game. Along the way through the maze they are able to collect items (presents and stars) to increase their score and add to the fun of the experience. This project was my capstone project for the Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree to present what I had learned and my skills gained during the course.
