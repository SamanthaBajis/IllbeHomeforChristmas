# IllbeHomeforChristmas
This repository contains a Unity 3D mobile application for iOS and Andriod devices called "I'll be Home for Christmas". It has been built and tested using the Google Cardboard Platform.

"I'll be Home for Christmas" is a maze scene where the user must complete the maze in order to win the experience and be able to restart the game. Along the way through the maze they are able to collect items (presents and stars) to boost their score and add to the fun of the experience. This project was my capstone project for the Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree to present what I had learned and my skills through the course.

# Building and creation of the Application
The Application was created using Unity 3D Patch Release 2017.1.0p4 and it can be built and ran to iOS through Xcode Version 9.2 or Version 9.3 Beta. The iOS device must have software version  11 and up. It also can be built and ran on Andriod devices post downloading the Andriod Studio SDK and Java JDK 8.  In order to either just play the scene on desktop and build the application the version of Unity must be Unity Patch Release 2017.1.0p4.

#Getting Started
In order to download and build application you must:
•	Go to the green "Clone or download" button and "Downland Zip"
• Once the zip file is on your desktop, double click the zip file, it will open. Navigate to the folder Assets > ChristmasMaze.unity (the scene may be a bit down the page but it will be titled exactly ChristmasMaze.unity with the Unity logo)

# How to play
The instructions to play the application "I'll be Home for Christmas" are very simple and very fun!
• After beginning the game, press the "Begin!" button on the start panel
• You can move throughout the maze by cicking on the sphereical waypoints to guide you with the Cardbord headset clicker.
• While going through the maze you can pick up any presents or stars you see to increase your score- keep an eye out for the stars, they are worth more points!
• After reaching the end of the maze you can restart the experience by clicking the Restart button you will be prompted with.
